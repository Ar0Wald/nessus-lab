An attacker who     successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the     ability to execute code on the target server.\n    (CVE-2017-11780)\n\n  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the     Microsoft Server Block Message (SMB) when an attacker     sends specially crafted requests to the server. An     attacker who exploited this vulnerability could cause     the affected system to crash. To attempt to exploit this     issue, an attacker would need to send specially crafted     SMB requests to the target system. Note that the denial     of service vulnerability would not allow an attacker to     execute code or to elevate their user rights, but it     could cause the affected system to stop accepting     requests. The security update addresses the     vulnerability by correcting the manner in which SMB     handles specially crafted client requests.\n    (CVE-2017-11781)\n\nNote that Microsoft uses AC:H for these two vulnerabilities.

An attacker     who successfully exploited this vulnerability could     cause a target computer to become completely     unresponsive. A remote unauthenticated attacker could     exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of TCP     packets to a target system, resulting in a permanent     denial of service condition. The update addresses the     vulnerability by correcting how the Windows network     stack handles NetBIOS traffic. (CVE-2017-0174)\n\n  - A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Microsoft     JET Database Engine that could allow remote code     execution on an affected system. An attacker who     successfully exploited this vulnerability could take     complete control of an affected system.

The update addresses     the vulnerability by correcting how privileges are     enforced by Windows Hyper-V instruction emulation.\n    (CVE-2018-8219)\n\n  - A security feature bypass vulnerability exists in Device     Guard that could allow an attacker to inject malicious     code into a Windows PowerShell session. An attacker who     successfully exploited this vulnerability could inject     code into a trusted PowerShell process to bypass the     Device Guard Code Integrity policy on the local machine.\n    (CVE-2018-8201, CVE-2018-8212, CVE-2018-8215,     CVE-2018-8216, CVE-2018-8217, CVE-2018-8221)\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists when     Microsoft Edge improperly accesses objects in memory.\n    The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way     that enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code in     the context of the current user. An attacker who     successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the     same user rights as the current user.  (CVE-2018-8236)\n\n  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the way that     the Windows Code Integrity Module performs hashing. An     attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability     could cause a system to stop responding. Note that the     denial of service condition would not allow an attacker     to execute code or to elevate user privileges. However,     the denial of service condition could prevent authorized     users from using system resources. An attacker could     host a specially crafted file in a website or SMB share.\n    The attacker could also take advantage of compromised     websites, or websites that accept or host user-provided     content or advertisements, by adding specially crafted     content that could exploit the vulnerability. However,     in all cases an attacker would have no way to force     users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead,     an attacker would have to convince users to take action,     typically via an enticement in email or instant message,     or by getting them to open an email attachment. The     security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying     how the Code Integrity Module performs hashing.\n    (CVE-2018-1040)\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists when     Windows improperly handles objects in memory. An     attacker who successfully exploited these     vulnerabilities could take control of an affected     system.  (CVE-2018-8210, CVE-2018-8213)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the     way that the Windows Kernel API enforces permissions.

            "description": "The remote Windows host is missing security update 4088787.\nIt is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities :\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in     Windows when Desktop Bridge does not properly manage the     virtual registry. An attacker who successfully exploited     this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel     mode. An attacker could then install programs; view,     change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full     user rights.  (CVE-2018-0880, CVE-2018-0882)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when     Storage Services improperly handles objects in memory.\n    An attacker who successfully exploited this     vulnerability could run processes in an elevated     context.  (CVE-2018-0983)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the     Windows kernel that could allow an attacker to retrieve     information that could lead to a Kernel Address Space     Layout Randomization (ASLR) bypass. An attacker who     successfully exploited the vulnerability could retrieve     the memory address of a kernel object.  (CVE-2018-0894,     CVE-2018-0895, CVE-2018-0896, CVE-2018-0897,     CVE-2018-0898, CVE-2018-0899, CVE-2018-0900,     CVE-2018-0901, CVE-2018-0904)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the     way that the Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI)     handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully     exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in     kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs;\n    view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts     with full user rights.  (CVE-2018-0816, CVE-2018-0817)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in     Windows when the Windows kernel-mode driver fails to     properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who     successfully exploited this vulnerability could run     arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then     install programs; view, change, or delete data; or     create new accounts with full user rights.\n    (CVE-2018-0977)\n\n  - A security feature bypass vulnerability exists in     Windows Scripting Host which could allow an attacker to     bypass Device Guard. An attacker who successfully     exploited this vulnerability could circumvent a User     Mode Code Integrity (UMCI) policy on the machine.\n    (CVE-2018-0884)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in     Windows when the Microsoft Video Control mishandles     objects in memory. An attacker who successfully     exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in     system mode. An attacker could then install programs;\n    view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts     with full user rights.  (CVE-2018-0881)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when     Internet Explorer fails a check, allowing sandbox     escape. An attacker who successfully exploited the     vulnerability could use the sandbox escape to elevate     privileges on an affected system. This vulnerability by     itself does not allow arbitrary code execution; however,     it could allow arbitrary code to be run if the attacker     uses it in combination with another vulnerability (such     as a remote code execution vulnerability or another     elevation of privilege vulnerability) that is capable of     leveraging the elevated privileges when code execution     is attempted. The update addresses the vulnerability by     correcting how Internet Explorer handles zone and     integrity settings. (CVE-2018-0942)\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the     Credential Security Support Provider protocol (CredSSP).\n    An attacker who successfully exploited this     vulnerability could relay user credentials and use them     to execute code on the target system. CredSSP is an     authentication provider which processes authentication     requests for other applications; any application which     depends on CredSSP for authentication may be vulnerable     to this type of attack. As an example of how an attacker     would exploit this vulnerability against Remote Desktop     Protocol, the attacker would need to run a specially     crafted application and perform a man-in-the-middle     attack against a Remote Desktop Protocol session. An     attacker could then install programs; view, change, or     delete data; or create new accounts with full user     rights. The security update addresses the vulnerability     by correcting how Credential Security Support Provider     protocol (CredSSP) validates requests during the     authentication process. To be fully protected against     this vulnerability users must enable Group Policy     settings on their systems and update their Remote     Desktop clients. The Group Policy settings are disabled     by default to prevent connectivity problems and users     must follow the instructions documented HERE to be fully     protected. (CVE-2018-0886)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when the     scripting engine does not properly handle objects in     memory in Microsoft browsers. An attacker who     successfully exploited the vulnerability could obtain     information to further compromise the users system.\n    (CVE-2018-0891)\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists when     Windows Shell does not properly validate file copy     destinations. An attacker who successfully exploited the     vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of     the current user. If the current user is logged on with     administrative user rights, an attacker could take     control of the affected system. An attacker could then     install programs; view, change, or delete data; or     create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose     accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the     system could be less impacted than users who operate     with administrative user rights.  (CVE-2018-0883)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when     affected Microsoft browsers improperly handle objects in     memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this     vulnerability could obtain information to further     compromise the users system.  (CVE-2018-0927,     CVE-2018-0932)\n\n  - A security feature bypass vulnerability exists in the     Cryptography Next Generation (CNG) kernel-mode driver     (cng.sys) when it fails to properly validate and enforce     impersonation levels. An attacker could exploit this     vulnerability by convincing a user to run a specially     crafted application that is designed to cause CNG to     improperly validate impersonation levels, potentially     allowing the attacker to gain access to information     beyond the access level of the local user. The security     update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the     kernel-mode driver validates and enforces impersonation     levels. (CVE-2018-0902)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when     Windows Hyper-V on a host operating system fails to     properly validate input from an authenticated user on a     guest operating system.  (CVE-2018-0888)\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way     that the scripting engine handles objects in memory in     Microsoft Edge. The vulnerability could corrupt memory     in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary     code in the context of the current user. An attacker who     successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the     same user rights as the current user.  (CVE-2018-0876,     CVE-2018-0893)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when     Windows Remote Assistance incorrectly processes XML     External Entities (XXE). An attacker who successfully     exploited the vulnerability could obtain information to     further compromise the users system.  (CVE-2018-0878)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when     Internet Explorer improperly handles objects in memory.\n    An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability     could obtain information to further compromise the users     system.  (CVE-2018-0929)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in     Windows when the Desktop Bridge VFS does not take into     acccount user/kernel mode when managing file paths. An     attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability     could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker     could then install programs; view, change, or delete     data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\n    (CVE-2018-0877)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the     Windows Installer when the Windows Installer fails to     properly sanitize input leading to an insecure library     loading behavior. A locally authenticated attacker could     run arbitrary code with elevated system privileges. An     attacker could then install programs; view, change, or     delete data; or create new accounts with full user     rights. The security update addresses the vulnerability     by correcting the input sanitization error to preclude     unintended elevation. (CVE-2018-0868)\n\n  - A denial of service vulnerability exists when Microsoft     Hyper-V Network Switch on a host server fails to     properly validate input from a privileged user on a     guest operating system. An attacker who successfully     exploited the vulnerability could cause the host server     to crash.  (CVE-2018-0885)\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way     that the scripting engine handles objects in memory in     Internet Explorer. The vulnerability could corrupt     memory in such a way that an attacker could execute     arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

As an example of how an attacker     would exploit this vulnerability against Remote Desktop     Protocol, the attacker would need to run a specially     crafted application and perform a man-in-the-middle     attack against a Remote Desktop Protocol session. An     attacker could then install programs; view, change, or     delete data; or create new accounts with full user     rights. The security update addresses the vulnerability     by correcting how Credential Security Support Provider     protocol (CredSSP) validates requests during the     authentication process. To be fully protected against     this vulnerability users must enable Group Policy     settings on their systems and update their Remote     Desktop clients. The Group Policy settings are disabled     by default to prevent connectivity problems and users     must follow the instructions documented HERE to be fully     protected. (CVE-2018-0886)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when the     scripting engine does not properly handle objects in     memory in Microsoft browsers.
