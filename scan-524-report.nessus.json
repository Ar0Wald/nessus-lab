A remote unauthenticated attacker could     exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of TCP     packets to a target system, resulting in a permanent     denial of service condition. The update addresses the     vulnerability by correcting how the Windows network     stack handles NetBIOS traffic. (CVE-2017-0174)\n\n  - A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Microsoft     JET Database Engine that could allow remote code     execution on an affected system. An attacker who     successfully exploited this vulnerability could take     complete control of an affected system. An attacker     could then install programs; view, change, or delete     data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\n    (CVE-2017-0250)\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists when     Microsoft Windows PDF Library improperly handles objects     in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in a     way that enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code     in the context of the current user. An attacker who     successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the     same user rights as the current user. (CVE-2017-0293)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in     Microsoft Edge that could allow an attacker to escape     from the AppContainer sandbox in the browser. An     attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability     could gain elevated privileges and break out of the Edge     AppContainer sandbox.The vulnerability by itself does     not allow arbitrary code to run. However, this     vulnerability could be used in conjunction with one or     more vulnerabilities (for example a remote code     execution vulnerability and another elevation of     privilege vulnerability) to take advantage of the     elevated privileges when running.The security update     addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Microsoft     Edge handles sandboxing. (CVE-2017-8503)\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Windows     Input Method Editor (IME) when IME improperly handles     parameters in a method of a DCOM class. The DCOM server     is a Windows component installed regardless of which     languages/IMEs are enabled. An attacker can instantiate     the DCOM class and exploit the system even if IME is not     enabled.

The vulnerability could allow     an attacker to bypass Device Guard UCMI policies.To     exploit the vulnerability, a user could either visit a     malicious website or an attacker with access to the     system could run a specially crafted application. An     attacker could then leverage the vulnerability to run     unsigned malicious code as though it were signed by a     trusted source.The update addresses the vulnerability by     correcting how Internet Explorer validates UMCI     policies. (CVE-2017-8625)\n\n  - This security update resolves a vulnerability in Windows     Error Reporting (WER). The vulnerability could allow     elevation of privilege if successfully exploited by an     attacker.

As an example of how an attacker     would exploit this vulnerability against Remote Desktop     Protocol, the attacker would need to run a specially     crafted application and perform a man-in-the-middle     attack against a Remote Desktop Protocol session. An     attacker could then install programs; view, change, or     delete data; or create new accounts with full user     rights. The security update addresses the vulnerability     by correcting how Credential Security Support Provider     protocol (CredSSP) validates requests during the     authentication process. To be fully protected against     this vulnerability users must enable Group Policy     settings on their systems and update their Remote     Desktop clients. The Group Policy settings are disabled     by default to prevent connectivity problems and users     must follow the instructions documented HERE to be fully     protected. (CVE-2018-0886)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when the     scripting engine does not properly handle objects in     memory in Microsoft browsers.

An attacker who successfully exploited the     vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of     the current user. If the current user is logged on with     administrative user rights, an attacker could take     control of the affected system. An attacker could then     install programs; view, change, or delete data; or     create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose     accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the     system could be less impacted than users who operate     with administrative user rights.  (CVE-2018-0883)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when     affected Microsoft browsers improperly handle objects in     memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this     vulnerability could obtain information to further     compromise the users system.

(CVE-2018-8392,     CVE-2018-8393)\n\n  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the     Microsoft Server Block Message (SMB) when an attacker     sends specially crafted requests to the server. An     attacker who exploited this vulnerability could cause     the affected system to crash. To attempt to exploit this     issue, an attacker would need to send specially crafted     SMB requests to the target system. Note that the denial     of service vulnerability would not allow an attacker to     execute code or to elevate their user rights, but it     could cause the affected system to stop accepting     requests. The security update addresses the     vulnerability by correcting the manner in which SMB     handles specially crafted client requests.\n    (CVE-2018-8335)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the     way that the Windows Kernel handles objects in memory.\n    An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability     could execute code with elevated permissions.\n    (CVE-2018-8455)\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists when     Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory.\n    The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way     that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the     context of the current user.

The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a     way that enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code     in the context of the current user. An attacker who     successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the     same user rights as the current user. If the current     user is logged on with administrative user rights, an     attacker could take control of an affected system. An     attacker could then install programs; view, change, or     delete data; or create new accounts with full user     rights.  (CVE-2018-8464)\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists when     Microsoft .NET Framework processes input. An attacker     who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take     control of an affected system.  (CVE-2018-8421)\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way     that the Chakra scripting engine handles objects in     memory in Microsoft Edge. The vulnerability could     corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could     execute arbitrary code in the context of the current     user. An attacker who successfully exploited the     vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the     current user.

            "description": "The server's X.509 certificate cannot be trusted. This situation can occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be broken, as stated below :\n\n  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the     server might not be descended from a known public     certificate authority. This can occur either when the     top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed     certificate, or when intermediate certificates are     missing that would connect the top of the certificate     chain to a known public certificate authority.\n\n  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate     that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can     occur either when the scan occurs before one of the     certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the     certificate's 'notAfter' dates.\n\n  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature     that either didn't match the certificate's information     or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by     getting the certificate with the bad signature to be     re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be     verified are the result of the certificate's issuer     using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not     support or does not recognize.\n\nIf the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server.

            "description": "Nessus was able to determine that valid credentials were provided for an authentication protocol available on the remote target because it was able to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target using that authentication protocol at least once. Authentication was successful because the authentication protocol service was available remotely, the service was able to be identified, the authentication protocol was able to be negotiated successfully, and a set of credentials provided in the scan policy for that authentication protocol was accepted by the remote service.

A remote unauthenticated attacker could     exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of TCP     packets to a target system, resulting in a permanent     denial of service condition. The update addresses the     vulnerability by correcting how the Windows network     stack handles NetBIOS traffic. (CVE-2017-0174)\n\n  - A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Microsoft     JET Database Engine that could allow remote code     execution on an affected system.

The vulnerability could corrupt memory in a     way that enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code     in the context of the current user. An attacker who     successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the     same user rights as the current user. (CVE-2017-0293)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in     Microsoft Edge that could allow an attacker to escape     from the AppContainer sandbox in the browser.

            "description": "The remote Windows host is missing security update 4088787.\nIt is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities :\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in     Windows when Desktop Bridge does not properly manage the     virtual registry. An attacker who successfully exploited     this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel     mode. An attacker could then install programs; view,     change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full     user rights.  (CVE-2018-0880, CVE-2018-0882)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when     Storage Services improperly handles objects in memory.\n    An attacker who successfully exploited this     vulnerability could run processes in an elevated     context.  (CVE-2018-0983)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the     Windows kernel that could allow an attacker to retrieve     information that could lead to a Kernel Address Space     Layout Randomization (ASLR) bypass. An attacker who     successfully exploited the vulnerability could retrieve     the memory address of a kernel object.  (CVE-2018-0894,     CVE-2018-0895, CVE-2018-0896, CVE-2018-0897,     CVE-2018-0898, CVE-2018-0899, CVE-2018-0900,     CVE-2018-0901, CVE-2018-0904)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the     way that the Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI)     handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully     exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in     kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs;\n    view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts     with full user rights.  (CVE-2018-0816, CVE-2018-0817)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in     Windows when the Windows kernel-mode driver fails to     properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who     successfully exploited this vulnerability could run     arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then     install programs; view, change, or delete data; or     create new accounts with full user rights.\n    (CVE-2018-0977)\n\n  - A security feature bypass vulnerability exists in     Windows Scripting Host which could allow an attacker to     bypass Device Guard. An attacker who successfully     exploited this vulnerability could circumvent a User     Mode Code Integrity (UMCI) policy on the machine.\n    (CVE-2018-0884)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in     Windows when the Microsoft Video Control mishandles     objects in memory. An attacker who successfully     exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in     system mode. An attacker could then install programs;\n    view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts     with full user rights.  (CVE-2018-0881)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when     Internet Explorer fails a check, allowing sandbox     escape. An attacker who successfully exploited the     vulnerability could use the sandbox escape to elevate     privileges on an affected system. This vulnerability by     itself does not allow arbitrary code execution; however,     it could allow arbitrary code to be run if the attacker     uses it in combination with another vulnerability (such     as a remote code execution vulnerability or another     elevation of privilege vulnerability) that is capable of     leveraging the elevated privileges when code execution     is attempted. The update addresses the vulnerability by     correcting how Internet Explorer handles zone and     integrity settings. (CVE-2018-0942)\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the     Credential Security Support Provider protocol (CredSSP).\n    An attacker who successfully exploited this     vulnerability could relay user credentials and use them     to execute code on the target system. CredSSP is an     authentication provider which processes authentication     requests for other applications; any application which     depends on CredSSP for authentication may be vulnerable     to this type of attack. As an example of how an attacker     would exploit this vulnerability against Remote Desktop     Protocol, the attacker would need to run a specially     crafted application and perform a man-in-the-middle     attack against a Remote Desktop Protocol session. An     attacker could then install programs; view, change, or     delete data; or create new accounts with full user     rights. The security update addresses the vulnerability     by correcting how Credential Security Support Provider     protocol (CredSSP) validates requests during the     authentication process. To be fully protected against     this vulnerability users must enable Group Policy     settings on their systems and update their Remote     Desktop clients. The Group Policy settings are disabled     by default to prevent connectivity problems and users     must follow the instructions documented HERE to be fully     protected. (CVE-2018-0886)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when the     scripting engine does not properly handle objects in     memory in Microsoft browsers. An attacker who     successfully exploited the vulnerability could obtain     information to further compromise the users system.\n    (CVE-2018-0891)\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists when     Windows Shell does not properly validate file copy     destinations. An attacker who successfully exploited the     vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of     the current user. If the current user is logged on with     administrative user rights, an attacker could take     control of the affected system. An attacker could then     install programs; view, change, or delete data; or     create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose     accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the     system could be less impacted than users who operate     with administrative user rights.  (CVE-2018-0883)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when     affected Microsoft browsers improperly handle objects in     memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this     vulnerability could obtain information to further     compromise the users system.  (CVE-2018-0927,     CVE-2018-0932)\n\n  - A security feature bypass vulnerability exists in the     Cryptography Next Generation (CNG) kernel-mode driver     (cng.sys) when it fails to properly validate and enforce     impersonation levels. An attacker could exploit this     vulnerability by convincing a user to run a specially     crafted application that is designed to cause CNG to     improperly validate impersonation levels, potentially     allowing the attacker to gain access to information     beyond the access level of the local user. The security     update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the     kernel-mode driver validates and enforces impersonation     levels. (CVE-2018-0902)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when     Windows Hyper-V on a host operating system fails to     properly validate input from an authenticated user on a     guest operating system.  (CVE-2018-0888)\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way     that the scripting engine handles objects in memory in     Microsoft Edge. The vulnerability could corrupt memory     in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary     code in the context of the current user. An attacker who     successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the     same user rights as the current user.  (CVE-2018-0876,     CVE-2018-0893)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when     Windows Remote Assistance incorrectly processes XML     External Entities (XXE). An attacker who successfully     exploited the vulnerability could obtain information to     further compromise the users system.  (CVE-2018-0878)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when     Internet Explorer improperly handles objects in memory.\n    An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability     could obtain information to further compromise the users     system.  (CVE-2018-0929)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in     Windows when the Desktop Bridge VFS does not take into     acccount user/kernel mode when managing file paths. An     attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability     could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker     could then install programs; view, change, or delete     data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\n    (CVE-2018-0877)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the     Windows Installer when the Windows Installer fails to     properly sanitize input leading to an insecure library     loading behavior. A locally authenticated attacker could     run arbitrary code with elevated system privileges. An     attacker could then install programs; view, change, or     delete data; or create new accounts with full user     rights. The security update addresses the vulnerability     by correcting the input sanitization error to preclude     unintended elevation. (CVE-2018-0868)\n\n  - A denial of service vulnerability exists when Microsoft     Hyper-V Network Switch on a host server fails to     properly validate input from a privileged user on a     guest operating system. An attacker who successfully     exploited the vulnerability could cause the host server     to crash.  (CVE-2018-0885)\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way     that the scripting engine handles objects in memory in     Internet Explorer. The vulnerability could corrupt     memory in such a way that an attacker could execute     arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An     attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability     could gain the same user rights as the current user.\n    (CVE-2018-0889, CVE-2018-0935)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when the     Windows kernel improperly initializes objects in memory.\n    (CVE-2018-0811, CVE-2018-0813, CVE-2018-0814,     CVE-2018-0926)\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way     that the Chakra scripting engine handles objects in     memory in Microsoft Edge. The vulnerability could     corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could     execute arbitrary code in the context of the current     user. An attacker who successfully exploited the     vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the     current user.

            "description": "The server's X.509 certificate cannot be trusted. This situation can occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be broken, as stated below :\n\n  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the     server might not be descended from a known public     certificate authority. This can occur either when the     top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed     certificate, or when intermediate certificates are     missing that would connect the top of the certificate     chain to a known public certificate authority.\n\n  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate     that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can     occur either when the scan occurs before one of the     certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the     certificate's 'notAfter' dates.\n\n  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature     that either didn't match the certificate's information     or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by     getting the certificate with the bad signature to be     re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be     verified are the result of the certificate's issuer     using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not     support or does not recognize.\n\nIf the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.",
