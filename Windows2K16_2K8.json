An attacker who successfully exploited     the vulnerability could obtain information to further     compromise the users system. There are multiple ways an     attacker could exploit the vulnerability, such as by     convincing a user to open a specially crafted document,     or by convincing a user to visit an untrusted webpage.\n    The security update addresses the vulnerability by     correcting how the Windows GDI component handles objects     in memory. (CVE-2018-8394, CVE-2018-8398)\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way     that Microsoft browsers access objects in memory. The     vulnerability could corrupt memory in a way that could     allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the     context of the current user. An attacker who     successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the     same user rights as the current user.  (CVE-2018-8403)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when     affected Microsoft browsers improperly allow cross-frame     interaction. An attacker who successfully exploited this     vulnerability could allow an attacker to obtain browser     frame or window state from a different domain. For an     attack to be successful, an attacker must persuade a     user to open a malicious website from a secure website.\n    This update addresses the vulnerability by denying     permission to read the state of the object model, to     which frames or windows on different domains should not     have access. (CVE-2018-8351)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in     Microsoft browsers allowing sandbox escape. An attacker     who successfully exploited the vulnerability could use     the sandbox escape to elevate privileges on an affected     system. This vulnerability by itself does not allow     arbitrary code execution; however, it could allow     arbitrary code to be run if the attacker uses it in     combination with another vulnerability (such as a remote     code execution vulnerability or another elevation of     privilege vulnerability) that is capable of leveraging     the elevated privileges when code execution is     attempted. (CVE-2018-8357)\n\n  - An Elevation of Privilege vulnerability exists when     Diagnostics Hub Standard Collector allows file creation     in arbitrary locations.  (CVE-2018-0952)\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way     that the scripting engine handles objects in memory in     Internet Explorer.

An attacker who successfully exploited     this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel     mode. An attacker could then install programs; view,     change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full     user rights.  (CVE-2018-0880, CVE-2018-0882)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when     Storage Services improperly handles objects in memory.\n    An attacker who successfully exploited this     vulnerability could run processes in an elevated     context.  (CVE-2018-0983)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the     Windows kernel that could allow an attacker to retrieve     information that could lead to a Kernel Address Space     Layout Randomization (ASLR) bypass. An attacker who     successfully exploited the vulnerability could retrieve     the memory address of a kernel object.  (CVE-2018-0894,     CVE-2018-0895, CVE-2018-0896, CVE-2018-0897,     CVE-2018-0898, CVE-2018-0899, CVE-2018-0900,     CVE-2018-0901, CVE-2018-0904)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the     way that the Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI)     handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully     exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in     kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs;\n    view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts     with full user rights.  (CVE-2018-0816, CVE-2018-0817)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in     Windows when the Windows kernel-mode driver fails to     properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who     successfully exploited this vulnerability could run     arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then     install programs; view, change, or delete data; or     create new accounts with full user rights.\n    (CVE-2018-0977)\n\n  - A security feature bypass vulnerability exists in     Windows Scripting Host which could allow an attacker to     bypass Device Guard. An attacker who successfully     exploited this vulnerability could circumvent a User     Mode Code Integrity (UMCI) policy on the machine.\n    (CVE-2018-0884)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in     Windows when the Microsoft Video Control mishandles     objects in memory. An attacker who successfully     exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in     system mode. An attacker could then install programs;\n    view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts     with full user rights.  (CVE-2018-0881)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when     Internet Explorer fails a check, allowing sandbox     escape. An attacker who successfully exploited the     vulnerability could use the sandbox escape to elevate     privileges on an affected system. This vulnerability by     itself does not allow arbitrary code execution; however,     it could allow arbitrary code to be run if the attacker     uses it in combination with another vulnerability (such     as a remote code execution vulnerability or another     elevation of privilege vulnerability) that is capable of     leveraging the elevated privileges when code execution     is attempted. The update addresses the vulnerability by     correcting how Internet Explorer handles zone and     integrity settings. (CVE-2018-0942)\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the     Credential Security Support Provider protocol (CredSSP).\n    An attacker who successfully exploited this     vulnerability could relay user credentials and use them     to execute code on the target system. CredSSP is an     authentication provider which processes authentication     requests for other applications; any application which     depends on CredSSP for authentication may be vulnerable     to this type of attack. As an example of how an attacker     would exploit this vulnerability against Remote Desktop     Protocol, the attacker would need to run a specially     crafted application and perform a man-in-the-middle     attack against a Remote Desktop Protocol session. An     attacker could then install programs; view, change, or     delete data; or create new accounts with full user     rights. The security update addresses the vulnerability     by correcting how Credential Security Support Provider     protocol (CredSSP) validates requests during the     authentication process. To be fully protected against     this vulnerability users must enable Group Policy     settings on their systems and update their Remote     Desktop clients. The Group Policy settings are disabled     by default to prevent connectivity problems and users     must follow the instructions documented HERE to be fully     protected. (CVE-2018-0886)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when the     scripting engine does not properly handle objects in     memory in Microsoft browsers. An attacker who     successfully exploited the vulnerability could obtain     information to further compromise the users system.\n    (CVE-2018-0891)\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists when     Windows Shell does not properly validate file copy     destinations. An attacker who successfully exploited the     vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of     the current user. If the current user is logged on with     administrative user rights, an attacker could take     control of the affected system. An attacker could then     install programs; view, change, or delete data; or     create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose     accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the     system could be less impacted than users who operate     with administrative user rights.  (CVE-2018-0883)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when     affected Microsoft browsers improperly handle objects in     memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this     vulnerability could obtain information to further     compromise the users system.  (CVE-2018-0927,     CVE-2018-0932)\n\n  - A security feature bypass vulnerability exists in the     Cryptography Next Generation (CNG) kernel-mode driver     (cng.sys) when it fails to properly validate and enforce     impersonation levels. An attacker could exploit this     vulnerability by convincing a user to run a specially     crafted application that is designed to cause CNG to     improperly validate impersonation levels, potentially     allowing the attacker to gain access to information     beyond the access level of the local user. The security     update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the     kernel-mode driver validates and enforces impersonation     levels. (CVE-2018-0902)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when     Windows Hyper-V on a host operating system fails to     properly validate input from an authenticated user on a     guest operating system.  (CVE-2018-0888)\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way     that the scripting engine handles objects in memory in     Microsoft Edge. The vulnerability could corrupt memory     in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary     code in the context of the current user. An attacker who     successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the     same user rights as the current user.  (CVE-2018-0876,     CVE-2018-0893)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when     Windows Remote Assistance incorrectly processes XML     External Entities (XXE). An attacker who successfully     exploited the vulnerability could obtain information to     further compromise the users system.  (CVE-2018-0878)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when     Internet Explorer improperly handles objects in memory.\n    An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability     could obtain information to further compromise the users     system.  (CVE-2018-0929)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in     Windows when the Desktop Bridge VFS does not take into     acccount user/kernel mode when managing file paths. An     attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability     could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker     could then install programs; view, change, or delete     data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\n    (CVE-2018-0877)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the     Windows Installer when the Windows Installer fails to     properly sanitize input leading to an insecure library     loading behavior. A locally authenticated attacker could     run arbitrary code with elevated system privileges. An     attacker could then install programs; view, change, or     delete data; or create new accounts with full user     rights. The security update addresses the vulnerability     by correcting the input sanitization error to preclude     unintended elevation. (CVE-2018-0868)\n\n  - A denial of service vulnerability exists when Microsoft     Hyper-V Network Switch on a host server fails to     properly validate input from a privileged user on a     guest operating system. An attacker who successfully     exploited the vulnerability could cause the host server     to crash.  (CVE-2018-0885)\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way     that the scripting engine handles objects in memory in     Internet Explorer. The vulnerability could corrupt     memory in such a way that an attacker could execute     arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An     attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability     could gain the same user rights as the current user.\n    (CVE-2018-0889, CVE-2018-0935)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when the     Windows kernel improperly initializes objects in memory.\n    (CVE-2018-0811, CVE-2018-0813, CVE-2018-0814,     CVE-2018-0926)\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way     that the Chakra scripting engine handles objects in     memory in Microsoft Edge. The vulnerability could     corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could     execute arbitrary code in the context of the current     user. An attacker who successfully exploited the     vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the     current user.

Users whose     accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the     system could be less impacted than users who operate     with administrative user rights.  (CVE-2018-8392,     CVE-2018-8393)\n\n  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the     Microsoft Server Block Message (SMB) when an attacker     sends specially crafted requests to the server. An     attacker who exploited this vulnerability could cause     the affected system to crash. To attempt to exploit this     issue, an attacker would need to send specially crafted     SMB requests to the target system. Note that the denial     of service vulnerability would not allow an attacker to     execute code or to elevate their user rights, but it     could cause the affected system to stop accepting     requests. The security update addresses the     vulnerability by correcting the manner in which SMB     handles specially crafted client requests.\n    (CVE-2018-8335)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the     way that the Windows Kernel handles objects in memory.\n    An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability     could execute code with elevated permissions.\n    (CVE-2018-8455)\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists when     Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory.\n    The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way     that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the     context of the current user.

The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a     way that enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code     in the context of the current user. An attacker who     successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the     same user rights as the current user. If the current     user is logged on with administrative user rights, an     attacker could take control of an affected system. An     attacker could then install programs; view, change, or     delete data; or create new accounts with full user     rights.  (CVE-2018-8464)\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists when     Microsoft .NET Framework processes input. An attacker     who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take     control of an affected system.  (CVE-2018-8421)\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way     that the Chakra scripting engine handles objects in     memory in Microsoft Edge. The vulnerability could     corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could     execute arbitrary code in the context of the current     user. An attacker who successfully exploited the     vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the     current user.

        "description": "The version of Apache httpd installed on the remote host is prior to 2.4.56. It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the 2.4.56 advisory.\n\n  - HTTP request splitting with mod_rewrite and mod_proxy: Some mod_proxy configurations on Apache HTTP Server     versions 2.4.0 through 2.4.55 allow a HTTP Request Smuggling attack. Configurations are affected when     mod_proxy is enabled along with some form of RewriteRule or ProxyPassMatch in which a non-specific pattern     matches some portion of the user-supplied request-target (URL) data and is then re-inserted into the     proxied request-target using variable substitution. For example, something like: RewriteEngine on     RewriteRule ^/here/(.*)  http://example.com:8080/elsewhere?$1 http://example.com:8080/elsewhere ; [P]     ProxyPassReverse /here/ http://example.com:8080/ http://example.com:8080/ Request splitting/smuggling     could result in bypass of access controls in the proxy server, proxying unintended URLs to existing origin     servers, and cache poisoning.

It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the 2.4.54 advisory.\n\n  - Possible request smuggling in mod_proxy_ajp: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request     Smuggling') vulnerability in mod_proxy_ajp of Apache HTTP Server allows an attacker to smuggle requests to     the AJP server it forwards requests to.  This issue affects Apache HTTP Server Apache HTTP Server 2.4     version 2.4.53 and prior versions. Acknowledgements: Ricter Z @ 360 Noah Lab (CVE-2022-26377)\n\n  - Read beyond bounds in mod_isapi: Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier on Windows may read beyond bounds     when configured to process requests with the mod_isapi module.  Acknowledgements: The Apache HTTP Server     project would like to thank Ronald Crane (Zippenhop LLC) for reporting this issue (CVE-2022-28330)\n\n  - Read beyond bounds via ap_rwrite(): The ap_rwrite() function in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may     read unintended memory if an attacker can cause the server to reflect very large input using ap_rwrite()     or ap_rputs(), such as with mod_luas r:puts() function. Acknowledgements: The Apache HTTP Server project     would like to thank Ronald Crane (Zippenhop LLC) for reporting this issue (CVE-2022-28614)\n\n  - Read beyond bounds in ap_strcmp_match(): Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may crash or disclose     information due to a read beyond bounds in ap_strcmp_match() when provided with an extremely large input     buffer.  While no code distributed with the server can be coerced into such a call, third-party modules or     lua scripts that use ap_strcmp_match() may hypothetically be affected. Acknowledgements: The Apache HTTP     Server project would like to thank Ronald Crane (Zippenhop LLC) for reporting this issue (CVE-2022-28615)\n\n  - Denial of service in mod_lua r:parsebody: In Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier, a malicious request to a     lua script that calls r:parsebody(0) may cause a denial of service due to no default limit on possible     input size. Acknowledgements: The Apache HTTP Server project would like to thank Ronald Crane (Zippenhop     LLC) for reporting this issue (CVE-2022-29404)\n\n  - Denial of Service mod_sed: If Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 is configured to do transformations with mod_sed in     contexts where the input to mod_sed may be very large, mod_sed may make excessively large memory     allocations and trigger an abort. Acknowledgements: This issue was found by Brian Moussalli from the JFrog     Security Research team (CVE-2022-30522)\n\n  - Information Disclosure in mod_lua with websockets: Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may return lengths     to applications calling r:wsread() that point past the end of the storage allocated for the buffer.\n    Acknowledgements: The Apache HTTP Server project would like to thank Ronald Crane (Zippenhop LLC) for     reporting this issue (CVE-2022-30556)\n\n  - X-Forwarded-For dropped by hop-by-hop mechanism in mod_proxy: Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may not     send the X-Forwarded-* headers to the origin server based on client side Connection header hop-by-hop     mechanism. This may be used to bypass IP based authentication on the origin server/application.\n    Acknowledgements: The Apache HTTP Server project would like to thank Gaetan Ferry (Synacktiv) for     reporting this issue (CVE-2022-31813)\n\nNote that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.",

Configurations are affected when     mod_proxy is enabled along with some form of RewriteRule or ProxyPassMatch in which a non-specific pattern     matches some portion of the user-supplied request-target (URL) data and is then re-inserted into the     proxied request-target using variable substitution.
